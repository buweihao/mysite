## 🛒 Retrieve Shopify Token & Add Demo Products

> **Note:** Shopify has transitioned to the new **Headless Sales Channel** authentication system using Public/Private Access Tokens. The old "Private Apps" system is deprecated. Follow the steps below to get your tokens.

### Step 1: Create a Shopify Store

- To get the tokens needed, create a Shopify partner account.

- Now go to 'Stores' and select 'Add store.' Create a development store using the option 'Create development store'.
  ![Screenshot_2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tfmurad/images-shopify-commerce/refs/heads/main/2.png)

- Click on import products.
  ![Screenshot_3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tfmurad/images-shopify-commerce/refs/heads/main/3.png)

- Locate the 'products' CSV file in the public folder of the repository and upload it for demo products.
  ![Screenshot_4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tfmurad/images-shopify-commerce/refs/heads/main/4.png)

### Step 2: Create a Headless Sales Channel (New Method)

- On the admin dashboard, click on 'Settings' at the bottom of the left sidebar.
  ![Screenshot_5](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tfmurad/images-shopify-commerce/refs/heads/main/5.png)

- On the Settings page, click on 'Apps and sales channels' on the left sidebar.
  ![Screenshot_6](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tfmurad/images-shopify-commerce/refs/heads/main/6.png)

- Click on 'Shopify App Store' to browse apps.

- Search for and install the **"Headless"** sales channel app (official Shopify app).

- Once installed, open the Headless channel and click 'Create storefront'.

- Give your storefront a name (e.g., "Next.js Storefront").

- Navigate to the 'API credentials' or 'Storefront API' tab to get your tokens:
  - **Private Access Token**: Used for server-side API calls (required)
  - **Public Access Token**: Used for client-side/browser queries (optional)
  - **Storefront API endpoint**: Your store domain (e.g., `your-store.myshopify.com`)

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your credentials:

```bash
PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN="your-store.myshopify.com"
PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_PRIVATE_ACCESS_TOKEN="your-private-access-token"
PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_REVALIDATION_SECRET="your-revalidation-secret"  # Optional, for webhooks
```

> **Migration from old system:** If you have existing `PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_ACCESS_TOKEN` or `PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_API_SECRET_KEY` values, they will continue to work. However, we recommend migrating to the new token format for better security.

- When adding your product, use the same alt title for images with the same color. This helps the first image appear as the color variant in the selector.

  ![Screenshot_14](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tfmurad/images-shopify-commerce/refs/heads/main/14.png)

- We have the option to create additional collections for products.

## 🚀 Setting Up the Hero Slider

1. Go to the file `/src/config/config.json` in your Shopify project and find the 'hero_slider' section. You’ll see something like this:

   ```json
   "shopify": {
     "currencySymbol": "৳",
     "currencyCode": "BDT",
     "collections": {
       "hero_slider": "hidden-homepage-carousel",
       "featured_products": "featured-products"
     }
   }
   ```

2. Change the 'hero_slider' collection name to something of your choice.

3. Then, go to your Shopify Partner Dashboard, navigate to Products > Collections, and create a collection with the same name you set in the config file (e.g., 'hidden-homepage-carousel').

4. Add the products you want to display in the hero slider to this collection.
